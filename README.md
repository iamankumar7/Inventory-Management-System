## 🗄️ Database Schema

The application uses complex JPA relationships:

```
Product (1) ────< (N) Stock >──── (1) Warehouse
                    │
Supplier (1) ────< (N) Purchase >──── (1) Product
                                 >──── (1) Warehouse

Product (1) ────< (N) Sale >──── (1) Warehouse

Product (1) ────< (N) Transfer
Warehouse (1) ──< (N) Transfer (from)
Warehouse (1) ──< (N) Transfer (to)
```

**Key Relationships:**
- **Product → Stock**: One-to-Many (One product can exist in multiple warehouses)
- **Warehouse → Stock**: One-to-Many (One warehouse can store multiple products)
- **Supplier → Purchase**: One-to-Many (One supplier can have multiple purchase orders)
- **Product → Purchase/Sale/Transfer**: One-to-Many relationships for tracking

**Key Components:**
- **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests/responses, validates input, manages REST endpoints
- **Service Layer**: Contains business logic, transaction management, orchestrates operations
- **Repository Layer**: Data access abstraction using Spring Data JPA with custom queries
- **Database**: MySQL persistence with complex relationships and constraints
- **Transaction Management**: Ensures data consistency for multi-step operations (transfers, sales)
- **Stock Management**: Real-time inventory tracking with automatic updates on purchases/sales

**Special Features:**
